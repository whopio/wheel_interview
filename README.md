## Overview

Welcome to the Whop Wheel Rails Project.

In this project, you will be building a Rails application that allows users to spin a wheel to win prizes.


## Setup

1. **Create a GitHub Codespace:**
   - Click the "Code" button on the GitHub repository page.
   - Select the "Codespaces" tab.
   - Click "Create codespace on main".

2. **Once the Codespace is ready:**
   - The project will be automatically set up for you.
   - Run `bundle install` to install the dependencies.

3. **Start the Rails server:**
   - Run `rails server` to start the Rails server. It will run on port 3000.

> You can also run this all on your local machine if you'd like. You just need Rails and Ruby installed. It uses a SQLite database.

## Instructions

Your job is to build a REST API that will be used by the frontend to spin the wheel and display the results.
